# java socket programming

Socket programming in Java is used for communication between the applications that are running on different JRE. It can be either connection-oriented or connectionless. On the whole, a socket is a way to establish a connection between a client and a server.

<h3> what is a Socket ? </h3>

<i> - Oracle doc says - </i>

A socket is one end-point of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. Socket classes are used to represent the connection between a client program and a server program. The java.net package provides two classes--Socket and ServerSocket--that implement the client side of the connection and the server side of the connection, respectively.

<i> "A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to." </i>
